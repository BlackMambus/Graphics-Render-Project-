Graphics rendering is the process of generating a visual image from a model using computer software or hardware. It’s like turning a blueprint into a photorealistic scene—or stylized game art—depending on the context. Rendering converts data (like geometry, textures, lighting, and shading) into a final 2D image or animation frame.
